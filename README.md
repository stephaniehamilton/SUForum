Creating a forum for the TV show Steven Universe. There is so much lore and fan theory that I thought it would be interesting. 
I am going to keep working on it, because as it stands, it is functional and covers the requirements but is not even near what I want.

I need to:

figure out how to make the response I get from the server appear BELOW the form.
figure out how to link comments to specific posts.
Do a LOT more with CSS.
Add more pages 
And probably much more that I will discover along the way. I spent a good deal of time trying to fully understand how the servers work, and it really cut into my project time!
